# Istio Destination Rules for traffic management
# These rules define traffic policies and service subsets for load balancing and routing

# A/B Testing Configuration:
# Our application implements A/B testing with two versions of the frontend:
# - Version v1: Has a traditional button interface for predictions
# - Version v2: Has thumbs up/down interface for providing feedback on predictions
#
# Sticky Sessions:
# The trafficPolicy below uses source IP for consistent hash load balancing.
# This ensures users are consistently routed to the same version during their session.
# 
# To disable sticky sessions and see both A/B test versions:
# Comment out the trafficPolicy section in the frontend destination rule below.
#
# Rate Limiting:
# Rate limiting is implemented using the same source IP used for sticky sessions,
# ensuring consistent user experience and proper throttling per individual user.
